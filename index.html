        <h2>Hello. My name is Naomi Wilson.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior at Babson College pursuing a Bachelor of Science with
          concentrations in Business Analytics and Quantitative Methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I completed an internship at Travelers as part of the
          Business Insights & Analytics Leadership Development Program (BI&A
          LDP) and will be returning as a full-time BI&A LDP Participant in June
          of 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Babson, I am on the e-board for two student organizations. As the
          Co-President, I plan events and organizational growth for the Business
          Analytics Association, an organization with the aim of providing
          opportunities for students to gain analytical and technical skills
          relevant to the business analytics field. As the VP of Finance, I
          support budgeting and fundraising for Japan International Circle, an
          organization with the aim of promoting Japanese cultural awareness at
          Babson.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also enjoy studying Mandarin Chinese and Japanese and am engaged in
          various co-curricular activities as a Presidential and Women's
          Leadership Scholar.
        </p>
